# 🧠 AI-Powered Financial Risk Assessment Platform

This project is a comprehensive machine learning-driven system for evaluating financial risk across three key domains:
- **Credit Risk Assessment**
- **Portfolio Risk Modeling & Optimization**
- **Fraud Detection via Anomaly Detection Techniques**

Designed for real-world FinTech applications, the platform integrates advanced ML techniques, risk modeling, and financial simulations to support data-driven lending and investment decisions.

## 📊 Key Features

### 🏦 Credit Risk Assessment
- Predicts default probability for 100,000+ loan applicants using **logistic regression** and **XGBoost**.
- Incorporates **alternative credit scoring features** for enhanced predictive power.
- Outputs borrower-level risk scores to support credit approval workflows.

### 📈 Portfolio Risk Modeling
- Simulates asset price paths using **Monte Carlo simulation** based on historical volatility.
- Calculates **Value at Risk (VaR)** to quantify potential losses at various confidence intervals.
- Optimizes investment strategies based on **risk-adjusted performance metrics**.

### 🕵️ Fraud Detection
- Detects anomalous transactions using **decision trees** and **unsupervised learning (e.g. Isolation Forest)**.
- Achieves high precision in identifying fraud-like behavior within imbalanced datasets.
